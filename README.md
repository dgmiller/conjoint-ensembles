# conjoint-ensembles
Ensemble methods for hierarchical bayesian models used in conjoint analysis.

**Under Development**

+ Methods for generating simulated data
+ Stacking methods for model aggregation
+ Models for data pathologies: ANA (coeffs=0) and screening (coeffs=-inf)
+ Parallelization of model fitting
